                Lyte Foundation is raised on the purpose of being a charity foundation, we are a non-governmental organization, committed in helping the poor and the needy.
                We aim at expanding this charity foundation by building a full-fledged community, consisting of schools, factories, farms, houses, offices and administration, for the poor and the needy.
                We also hope that, by so doing, we rampantly reduce the degree of illiteracy and unemployment in the country.

                        <br>I can only thank God for his abundant mercies
                        <br>And dare not blame His superiority
                        <br>As I stand on my feet today
                        <br>I only need God to praise
                        <br>He is the father that raised me
                        <br>With cover, bread and knowlegde, He shielded me
                        <br>Let us not forget the comfort these people never had
                        <br>Let us draw them close to the ember
                        <br>That they may feel the warmth
                        <br>That is our greatest purpose

                        "Every day, there are people in our communities who are struggling to make ends meet. They are facing challenges such as poverty, hunger, and lack of access to basic necessities. 
                        But we believe that together, we can make a difference.
                        Through your generosity and support, we have been able to provide food, clothing, education, and healthcare to those in need. 
                        <br> We have seen firsthand the impact that your donations have made in the lives of the people we serve.
                        We have witnessed children who were once unable to attend school now receiving an education. We have seen families who were struggling to put food on the table now able to feed their children. We have seen people who were once without access to medical care now receiving the treatment they need to live healthy lives.
                        But there is still more work to be done. There are still people in our communities who need our help. 
                        <br> We ask that you continue to support our mission, so that together, we can make a lasting impact in the lives of those in need.
                        Your donations make a real difference in the lives of people who need it most. Thank you for your kindness and generosity."
